# 🧩 Stacks Assignment

Implement the class **`LinkedListBasedStack`** similar to the **`ArrayBasedStack`** class.

The class must include the following main methods:
- `push`
- `pop`
- `is_empty`
- `get_top`
- `size`

The stack should follow the LIFO principle and handle underflow conditions properly.
