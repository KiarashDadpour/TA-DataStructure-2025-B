# Tree Structures

A **tree** is a fundamental hierarchical data structure used to represent relationships between elements in a parent-child manner. Unlike linear data structures such as arrays, stacks, and queues, trees organize data in multiple levels.

A tree consists of **nodes**, where each node contains data and references to its child nodes. The topmost node is called the **root**, and nodes with no children are called **leaf nodes**. Trees are especially useful for representing hierarchical information.

### Common Terminology
- **Root**: The top node of the tree
- **Parent**: A node that has one or more children
- **Child**: A node that descends from another node
- **Leaf**: A node with no children
- **Height / Depth**: Measures of levels within the tree

### Common Types of Trees

- **Binary Tree**: Each node has at most two children.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree with ordered nodes, where left child values are smaller and right child values are larger than the parent.
- **Balanced Tree**: A tree where the height difference between subtrees is minimized (e.g., AVL, Red-Black Trees).
- **Heap**: A complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property (min-heap or max-heap).

### Key Operations
- Insertion of nodes
- Deletion of nodes
- Searching for values
- Tree traversals (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Level-order)

Trees are widely used in:
- Database indexing (e.g., B-Trees, B+ Trees)
- File systems and directory structures
- Syntax trees and expression parsing
- Artificial intelligence and decision-making algorithms
