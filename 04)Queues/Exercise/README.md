#  Queues Assignment

Implement the class **`LinkedListBasedQueue`** similar to the **`ArrayBasedQueue`** class.

The class must include the following main methods:
- `dequeue`
- `enqueue`
- `is_empty`
- `peek`

### Notes
- The queue must follow the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle.
- Handle underflow properly (e.g., dequeue from an empty queue).
- Do **not** use built-in queue libraries.
