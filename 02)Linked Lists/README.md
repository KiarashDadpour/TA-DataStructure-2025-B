## Linked List Structures
A linked list is a fundamental data structure used to store a sequence of elements in a dynamic way.  
Instead of using contiguous memory like arrays, linked lists are composed of nodes, where each node contains data and references (or links) to other nodes.  
This flexible structure allows efficient insertion and deletion of elements without rearranging the entire data.  

Different types of linked lists exist, such as:
- **Singly Linked List:** Each node points to the next node in the sequence.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Each node contains links to both its previous and next nodes, allowing bidirectional traversal.
- **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the first node, forming a closed loop.

Linked lists are widely used in algorithm design, dynamic memory management, and when efficient insertions and deletions are required.
