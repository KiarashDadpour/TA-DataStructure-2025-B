# 🧩 Linked Lists Assignment

Implement the classes **`DoublyLinkedList`** and **`CircularLinkedList`** similar to the **`SinglyLinkedList`** class.

Both classes must include the following main methods:
- `insert_head`
- `insert_tail`
- `insert_after_node`
- `delete_head`
- `delete_tail`
- `delete_after`
- `search_node`
- `get_size`
- `traversal`

In the **`DoublyLinkedList`**, each node should have both `next` and `prev` pointers.  
In the **`CircularLinkedList`**, the last node should point back to the first node.
